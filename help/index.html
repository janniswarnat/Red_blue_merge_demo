This program demonstrates the implementation of a divide and conquer algorithm to compute
a single cell in an arrangement of bounded line segments.

<A name="ins"></A><h3>Insert segment</h3>
First, press the "Insert" button. Left click the mouse to choose 
the source point, move the mouse to determine the segment and close it with 
another left click. 

<A name="del"></A><h3>Delete segment</h3>
Press the "Delete" button and left click any segment to remove it.

<A name="loc"></A><h3>Set Point</h3>
Press the "Set Point" button, and left click on any point not on any segment. The single face
containing this point will be computed and highlighted. Right click the mouse in "Set Point" 
mode to unset the point.

<A name="degen"></A><h3>Check for degeneracies</h3>
After inserting a set of line segments, click on the "Degenerate" button to check for some degeneracies
which cannot be handled by this implementation. The full arrangement
of the line segments is computed. The following conditions must hold:
<br>
<br>
<LI>Every endpoint of an original line segment must have degree one.</LI>
<LI>Every intersection of two original line segments must have degree four.</LI>
<br>
<br>
Degenerate vertices are highlighted. 

<A name ="grid"></A><h3>Grid</h3>
A grid of line segments is a typical situation in which the complexity of the full arrangement
of these line segments is quadratic. Click on the "Grid" button and choose the number
of vertical segments to get a set of line segments forming a random grid.

<A name ="random"></A><h3>Random</h3>
Click on the "Random" button and choose the number of line segments to get a 
random set of line segments. The endpoints of these line segments are randomly
distributed inside a square which size depends on the chosen number of segments.
 
<A name="format"></A><h3>File format</h3>
Sets of bounded line segments can be read from and saved to files in the following simple format (# denotes comments):
<br>
<br>
<UL>
0 # (optional) the 0 signals, that a point_x is to be read in <br>
1 1 # (optional) if the character in the first line is 0, read a point; in this case (1,1) <br>
2 # number of segments <br>
0 -10 0 10 # segment between (0,-10) and (0,10) <br>
-10 0 10 0 # segment between (-10,0) and (10,0) <br>
</UL>
